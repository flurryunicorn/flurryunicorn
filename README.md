### Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts

Once there was a software developer named Jason who was working on a complex project. He had spent weeks writing code, testing it, and fixing bugs. But when he thought everything was finally perfect, he discovered a major flaw that threatened to derail the entire project.

Jason felt like a failure and didn't know what to do. He considered giving up and scrapping the project altogether. But then he remembered the quote "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts".

He realized that setbacks and failures are a natural part of the development process and that what mattered most was his ability to persevere. With newfound determination, Jason went back to the drawing board and worked tirelessly to find a solution to the problem.

He consulted with his team, researched potential solutions, and experimented with different approaches until he finally found a fix. It wasn't easy, but Jason learned that true success in development comes from having the courage to face challenges head-on and never giving up.

In the end, the project was finished on time and within budget, and Jason's perseverance paid off in the form of a successful product launch. He knew that he would face more obstacles in the future, but he was ready to tackle them with the same courage and determination that had gotten him through this tough experience.
